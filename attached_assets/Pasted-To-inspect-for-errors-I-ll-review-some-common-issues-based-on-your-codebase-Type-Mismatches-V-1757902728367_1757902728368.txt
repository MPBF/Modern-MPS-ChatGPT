To inspect for errors, I'll review some common issues based on your codebase.

Type Mismatches & Validation Issues: From the logged errors, there are several type mismatches, especially with the Zod validation in your Express application. This often results from incorrect data types being passed to routes. For instance:

Ensure cut_weight_kg is always a number when creating cuts, as seen in your Zod validation error: "Expected number, received string".
Similarly, verify all fields in your validation schemas for proper types to avoid these errors in your routes.
Abort Errors in React Query: The AbortError: signal is aborted without reason might be due to query cancellations or timeouts. Make sure that queries are designed to handle cancellations gracefully.

Database Schema Constraint Violations: You are encountering null constraint violations, such as "null value in column 'id' of relation 'categories' violates not-null constraint". This indicates that some operations are missing required fields. Ensure data integrity before interactions with the database, possibly through pre-validation.

Unhandled Exceptions: There's also a mention of error handling improvements in your backend (PLATFORM-ISSUE-RESOLUTION.md discusses deployment-level errors). Make sure to:

Implement fallback mechanisms if critical operations fail.
Properly log and handle exceptions to avoid silent failures.
Error Boundary Usage: You have an ErrorBoundary component implemented in your client-side code to catch unexpected errors. Ensure itâ€™s wrapping components that are likely to throw errors, thus preventing the entire application from crashing.

Server Startup Errors: The server deployment scripts mention platform-level migration issues. Consider implementing the fallback approach suggesting connection verification and manual migration strategies as discussed.

For precise rectification, I would suggest looking into each of these problem areas, potentially adding logging to trace exact operations causing issues. If specific errors need to be resolved, adjusting validation schemas or enhancing exception handling might be necessary.
